com.vh.content.jsp.legal.title1=1. ACCEPTANCE OF TERMS
com.vh.content.jsp.legal.title2=2. DESCRIPTION OF SERVICE
com.vh.content.jsp.legal.title3=3. YOUR REGISTRATION OBLIGATIONS
com.vh.content.jsp.legal.title4=4. MEMBER ACCOUNT, PASSWORD AND SECURITY
com.vh.content.jsp.legal.main1=Welcome to Yahoo!. Yahoo! provides its service to you, subject to the following Terms of Service ("TOS"), which may be updated by us from time to time without notice to you. You can review the most current version of the TOS at any time at: http://docs.yahoo.com/info/terms/. In addition, when using particular Yahoo! owned or operated services, you and Yahoo! shall be subject to any posted guidelines or rules applicable to such services which may be posted from time to time. All such guidelines or rules (including but not limited to our Spam Policy) are hereby incorporated by reference into the TOS. Yahoo! may also offer other services that are governed by different Terms of Service. For instance, different terms apply to homesteaders on Yahoo! GeoCities, members of Yahoo! Plus, or members of SBC Yahoo! Dial or SBC Yahoo! DSL.
com.vh.content.jsp.legal.main2=Yahoo! currently provides users with access to a rich collection of resources, including, various communications tools, forums, shopping services, search services, personalized content and branded programming through its network of properties (the "Service"). You also understand and agree that the Service may include advertisements and that these advertisements are necessary for Yahoo! to provide the Service. You also understand and agree that the service may include certain communications from Yahoo!, such as service announcements, administrative messages and the Yahoo! Newsletter, and that these communications are considered part of Yahoo! membership and you will not be able to opt out of receiving them. Unless explicitly stated otherwise, any new features that augment or enhance the current Service, including the release of new Yahoo! properties, shall be subject to the TOS. You understand and agree that the Service is provided "AS-IS" and that Yahoo! assumes no responsibility for the timeliness, deletion, mis-delivery or failure to store any user communications or personalization settings. You are responsible for obtaining access to the Service and that access may involve third party fees (such as Internet service provider or airtime charges). You are responsible for those fees, including those fees associated with the display or delivery of advertisements. In addition, you must provide and are responsible for all equipment necessary to access the Service.
com.vh.content.jsp.legal.main3=In consideration of your use of the Service, you represent that you are of legal age to form a binding contract and are not a person barred from receiving services under the laws of the United States or other applicable jurisdiction. You also agree to: (a) provide true, accurate, current and complete information about yourself as prompted by the Service's registration form (such information being the "Registration Data") and (b) maintain and promptly update the Registration Data to keep it true, accurate, current and complete. If you provide any information that is untrue, inaccurate, not current or incomplete, or Yahoo! has reasonable grounds to suspect that such information is untrue, inaccurate, not current or incomplete, Yahoo! has the right to suspend or terminate your account and refuse any and all current or future use of the Service (or any portion thereof). Yahoo! is concerned about the safety and privacy of all its users, particularly children. For this reason, parents of children under the age of 13 who wish to allow their children access to the Service must create a Yahoo! Family Account. When you create a Yahoo! Family Account and add your child to the account, you certify that you are at least 18 years old and that you are the legal guardian of the child/children listed on the Yahoo! Family Account. By adding a child to your Yahoo! Family Account, you also give your child permission to access all of the Services including, email, message boards, instant messages and chat (among others). Please remember that the Service is designed to appeal to a broad audience. Accordingly, as the legal guardian, it is your responsibility to determine whether any of the Services and/or Content (as defined in Section 6 below) are appropriate for your child.
com.vh.content.jsp.legal.main4=You will receive a password and account designation upon completing the Service's registration process. You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of the password and account, and are fully responsible for all activities that occur under your password or account. You agree to (a) immediately notify Yahoo! of any unauthorized use of your password or account or any other breach of security, and (b) ensure that you exit from your account at the end of each session. Yahoo! cannot and will not be liable for any loss or damage arising from your failure to comply with this Section 5.

com.vh.content.jsp.mission.title1=Mission Statement
com.vh.content.jsp.mission.main1=To help people help themselves and their environment by providing resources, sharing knowledge, building capacity, and forging partnerships in the public and private sectors.
com.vh.content.jsp.mission.main2=To be an excellent institution able to attract, excite, and nurture diverse and committed staff with exceptional skills who know how to listen and learn.

com.vh.content.jsp.privacy.title1=Our privacy promise
com.vh.content.jsp.privacy.title2=What we collect, and why
com.vh.content.jsp.privacy.title3=Your options
com.vh.content.jsp.privacy.title4=How we assure security
com.vh.content.jsp.privacy.main1=Myplay, which owns the aggregated information collected from the site, wants to make your online experience safe and satisfying. This Privacy Policy, which will be updated as necessary at this page, explains how we do this. Our data-collection policies allow you to control how much information you give us, as well as how we use that information. Most importantly, we allow you to update and/or change the information that we have collected.
com.vh.content.jsp.privacy.main2=You can do a lot to protect your own privacy. Please remember that any information that is disclosed on the DJ Mixes page, such as your DJ name or the name of a shared or posted DJ Mix, becomes public information. Use caution and good judgment when disclosing personal information about yourself.
com.vh.content.jsp.privacy.main3=Finally, it is important to note that this site contains links to other sites. While we will endeavor to work with partners who follow our privacy philosophy, myplay is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of other Web sites.
com.vh.content.jsp.privacy.main4=Myplay collects both "personal information" and "aggregate information" from our users. Personal information is user-specific and includes information collected on the Registration page: your name and e-mail address, a password, and your Zip Code (optional). This information is used to identify you as a registered user and protect the contents of your Locker. As myplay allows you to organize and listen to your music collection, we may also track your music choices and preferences based on the contents of your Locker. This information may be used to provide you with special information and promotional offers according to your specific tastes. In addition, we collect so-called "third-party personally identifiable information," such as the e-mail addresses of people who have been invited by you to listen to a DJ Mix. Rest assured that we will never disclose your personal information, or that of an e-mail recipient, to third parties without your prior approval unless required by law. Moreover, if you authorize us to share personal information such as your e-mail address with our partners, you will always have the ability to "opt out" of receiving solicitations or other communications from those partners or myplay. To opt out, simply go to the "My Settings" page and change your preferences.
com.vh.content.jsp.privacy.main5=Myplay also collects aggregate information, which is a generalized accumulation of data derived from users of our service. Examples might include the number of users who requested a certain song. This generalized data will not contain personal information about you. We use this data to improve the user's experience on our Web site, and we share it with our partners to help all of us identify the interests and needs of those we serve.
com.vh.content.jsp.privacy.main6=Myplay also collects aggregate information, which is a generalized accumulation of data derived from users of our service. Examples might include the number of users who requested a certain song, contents of locker, and search queries. We verify these numbers by logging IP (Internet Protocol) addresses, browser type, domain names, and access times. We also use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our server and to administer our Web site. Some aggregate information is gathered in this process, but never personal information. The other generalized data will not contain personal information about you. We use this data to improve the user's experience on our Web site, and we share it with our partners to help all of us identify the interests and needs of those we serve.
com.vh.content.jsp.privacy.main7=There is certain personal information myplay will require in order to process your request to open a Locker. We will ask you for your e-mail address and password, for example, to confirm you as a registered user and to send you information about changes in service offered at myplay and our partners' sites. We also ask for your zip code (optional) in order to provide you with information specific to your geographic area such as concert alerts. At other times we may request additional personal information, which you will have the option to furnish. For example, we may also ask you questions about your interests, favorite bands and hobbies in order to create a user profile for you and allow us to send you information that may be of interest to you. Keep in mind, however, that if you choose not to share requested information with us, we may not be able to provide you with some of the services that are dependent upon the collection of such information.
com.vh.content.jsp.privacy.main8=A word about "cookies:" To activate the features available at myplay, we will assign to your Internet browser (be it Netscape Navigator™ or Microsoft Internet Explorer™) a unique ID number stored in a file, beyond the time of the session, on your computer. This file is called a cookie. Cookies are required to use myplay.
