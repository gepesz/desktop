How to create an EJB?

CREATE NEW EJB:
===============

1) Right click EJB Jar --> New EJB.
2) Add the fields with their types to the new EJB.
3) Make sure to select the checkbox next to the key field(s)!!
4) Open up ejb-jar.xml.  Goto the Beans tab, and enter the datasource's JNDI name for this new EJB.
5) Add any relationships and finders to this new EJB on the Beans tab.

6) Now the EJB is added with all its relationships and finders.  Write the methods you want: 
   ejbCreate, ejbPostCreate, update etc.  Modify the home and local interfaces accordingly.
7) When the EJB is complete, copy-paste local interface into a new ibean, and make sure the 
   local interface implements the ibean.
8) Add the JNDI name and Tablename of your new EJB to Contants.java.  Put the new table to
   AuditManager's hashMap.  Save everything you've done so far.

9) Go back to the ejb-jar.xml, and on the Access tab modify the access intent of your new finders.
10) Run jarup.bat to recreate appian-proc-util.jar under EJB module.  Refresh the 
    EAR module: You should see the EJB module with NO JAVA ERRORS at this point (only
    database mapping problems).

11) Now it's time for the mapping.  The best way to do it is to first delete the folder called 
    'backends' under the EJB module by Right click --> Delete.  This should clear all errors 
    seen previously on the Task bar.  Now, right click on the EJB module --> Generate --> 
    EJB to RDB mapping.  It'll ask you to create a new Top Down mapping, say yes.  
    Select Oracle 8.1.7 for your database type.  Type 'WB' instead of 'SAMPLE' for
    Database name.  Click OK.
12) All table.xmi-s have been regenerated.  Now you'll have to manually modify a couple of them.  
    The ones that need change are:
	- RELNotifMethodSR
	- InvitedFirms
	- RelCriteriaProposal
	- RelSubcriteriaProposal
	- [ rename User_DocType --> FILEPERM ]
	- FileVersion
	- SoleSource
  - SRCandidate
  - Notif

    All of these need foreign key change.  Right click on the xmi in the Mapping view --> 
    Open Table editor.  Goto the foreign key tab, and move the foreign keys to the fields 
    which should hold the foreign key values.  Then, goto the columns tab, and delete all 
    columns (previous foreign key cols) no longer needed.  Remember that you'll have to do 
    this for each of the above EJBs (plus rename one)!!

13) Open up web.xml.  Goto the References tab, and on the Local Refs sub-tab click Add.  Name your 
    new local ejb ref the same way as before: ejb/HOMENAME.  Select your new ejb at the right for 
    this new reference.

14) Write the service methods for your new ejb.  Remember that you'll need to add a new private 
    getHOMENAME() for this new EJB as well as a new private variable on top of your service to 
    hold your home interface.  Also, modify StartupServlet and add this EJB to be cached at
    application startup.

15) You're basically done at this point, except that you'll have to create the new 
    table & sequence in Oracle.  So go ahead and modify Table.ddl, Sequence.ddl and dml_data.ddl 
    to actually create the new Table.  Test yourself in Toad locally first.

16) Redeploy EJBs: Right click on EJB module --> Generate --> Deploy and RMIC code...  
    Wait, wait and wait...

17) CONGRATULATIONS!!
